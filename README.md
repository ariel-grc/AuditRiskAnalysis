# NIST Cybersecurity Audit & Risk Analysis 🔍  

## Overview  
This project simulates a **comprehensive cybersecurity audit** and **risk analysis** for an information system, aligned with the **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**. It evaluates a subset of **NIST SP 800-53 controls** through audit activities and **semi-quantitative risk assessment**, following the **NIST SP 800-30 methodology**.  

## Objectives  
1. **Assess compliance** with selected NIST SP 800-53 controls through documentation review, interviews, and system testing.  
2. **Identify implementation gaps** and evaluate the associated risks.  
3. **Conduct risk analysis** to prioritize system vulnerabilities.  
4. **Model threat scenarios** to determine likely threat events and inform mitigation strategies.  

## Tools & Frameworks Used  
| Framework/Tool | Purpose |  
|-----------|---------|  
| **NIST SP 800-53** | Security and privacy controls for information systems |  
| **NIST SP 800-30** | Guide for conducting risk assessments |  
| **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** | Risk management and cybersecurity improvement |  
| **Microsoft Excel** | Risk analysis matrix and report preparation |  

## Key Activities  
✔ **Control Audit** – Planning, interviewing, and evidence gathering  
✔ **Threat Modeling** – Simulating higher-likelihood threat events  
✔ **Risk Scoring** – Semi-quantitative risk prioritization  
✔ **Executive Reporting** – Risk dashboard generation  

## Deliverables  
📌 [**Final Audit & Risk Analysis Report**](https://github.com/ariel-grc/NIST-CSF-Audit-Risk-Analysis/blob/main/ARIEL%20BETHEA%20SIMPLY%20CYBER%20GRC%20ANALYST%20AUDIT%20.pdf) , including:  
- **Control status overview**  
- **Risk matrix and scoring**  
- **Threat likelihood and impact analysis**  
- **Recommendations for mitigation**  

## Use Case  
This project is ideal for:  
✅ **Demonstrating** cybersecurity audit processes  
✅ **Applying** NIST frameworks in practical GRC scenarios  
✅ **Showcasing** the ability to analyze, model, and communicate cybersecurity risk  

> **Note:** This project is a simulation for learning and portfolio purposes only. It does not evaluate a real-world organization.
