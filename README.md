# NIST Cybersecurity Audit & Risk Analysis üîç

## Overview
This project simulates a comprehensive cybersecurity audit and risk analysis for an information system, aligned with the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). It focuses on evaluating a subset of NIST SP 800-53 controls through audit activities and semi-quantitative risk assessment, following the NIST SP 800-30 methodology.

## Objectives
- Assess compliance with selected NIST SP 800-53 controls through documentation review, interviews, and system testing.
- Identify control implementation gaps and evaluate the associated risks.
- Conduct a semi-quantitative cybersecurity risk analysis to prioritize system vulnerabilities.
- Model threat scenarios to determine likely threat events and inform mitigation strategies.

## Tools & Frameworks Used
- **NIST SP 800-53** ‚Äì Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems
- **NIST SP 800-30** ‚Äì Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**
- **Microsoft Excel** ‚Äì Risk analysis matrix and report preparation

## Key Activities
- ‚úÖ Control audit (planning, interviewing, evidence gathering)
- ‚úÖ Threat modeling to simulate higher-likelihood threat events
- ‚úÖ Semi-quantitative risk scoring and prioritization
- ‚úÖ Executive summary and risk dashboard generation

## Deliverables
- [Final audit and risk analysis report including:](https://github.com/ariel-grc/healthcare-risk-management-methodology/blob/main/CareNova_Risk_Management_Methodology.pdf) 
  - Control status
  - Risk matrix and scoring
  - Threat likelihood and impact analysis
  - Recommendations for mitigation

## Use Case
Ideal for:
- Demonstrating understanding of cybersecurity auditing processes.
- Applying NIST frameworks in practical GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) scenarios.
- Showcasing the ability to analyze, model, and communicate cybersecurity risk.
