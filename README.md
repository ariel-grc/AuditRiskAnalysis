# NIST Cybersecurity Audit & Risk Analysis 🔍

## Overview
This project simulates a comprehensive cybersecurity audit and risk analysis for an information system, aligned with the **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**. It evaluates a subset of **NIST SP 800-53** controls through audit activities and semi-quantitative risk assessment, following the **NIST SP 800-30** methodology.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is a simulation for learning and portfolio purposes only. It does not evaluate a real-world organization.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Assess compliance with selected **NIST SP 800-53** controls via documentation review, interviews, and system testing.
- Identify implementation gaps and evaluate associated risks.
- Conduct risk analysis to prioritize system vulnerabilities.
- Model threat scenarios to determine likely threat events and inform mitigation strategies.
